# Roman Numeral Generator

This code kata has been built using PHP and utilises Codeception for the handling of Unit tests.
You will need to use composer to install the development dependencies.

PHP was selected as the language for this kata due to it being having been that language I have had most recent
exposure to and already having the appropriate toolset in place.

The aim of this kata to to demonstrate the development style and understanding of basic testing principles for
software development.

The kata was complete using TDD. All tests were defined in advance of the main Generator class to ensure that the code
met the required criteria as well as ensuring 100% code coverage for tests.
